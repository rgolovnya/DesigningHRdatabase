# Designing an Human Resources database - Tech ABC Corp (Video Game Company)

## Project Overview

In this project, I designed, built, and populated a database for the Human Resources (HR) Department of a video game company. I designed a database using the foundational principals of data architecture that was best suited to the department's needs. I went through the steps of database architecture, creating database proposals, database entity relationship diagrams (ERD), and finally creating the database itself.
